A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).

Knowledge about the structure and function of previous coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms in early 2020.[1] In 2020, the first COVID‑19 vaccines were developed and made available to the public through emergency authorizations[2] and conditional approvals.[3][4] However, immunity from the vaccines wanes over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID‑19.[2]

The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID‑19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19.[2][5] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.[6][7]

Common side effects of COVID‑19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days.[8][9] COVID‑19 vaccination is safe for people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding.[10]

As of August 2024, 13.72 billion doses of COVID‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide, based on official reports from national public health agencies.[11] By December 2020, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries,[12] with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising 14% of the world's population.[13]

Despite the extremely rapid development of effective mRNA and viral vector vaccines, worldwide vaccine equity has not been achieved. The development and use of whole inactivated virus (WIV) and protein-based vaccines have also been recommended, especially for use in developing countries.[14][15]

The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID‑19.[16][17][18]


Vaccine technologies

Vaccine platforms that are being employed for SARS-CoV-2. Whole-virus vaccines include both attenuated and inactivated forms of the virus. Protein and peptide subunit vaccines are usually combined with an adjuvant in order to enhance immunogenicity. The main emphasis in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development has been on using the whole spike protein in its trimeric form, or components of it, such as the RBD region. Multiple non-replicating viral vector vaccines have been developed, particularly focused on adenovirus, while there has been less emphasis on the replicating viral vector constructs.[38]
The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe, illness.[39] Most of the first COVID‑19 vaccines were two-dose vaccines, with the exception single-dose vaccines Convidecia[40] and the Janssen COVID‑19 vaccine,[2] and vaccines with three-dose schedules, Razi Cov Pars[41] and Soberana.[42]

As of July 2021, at least nine different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.[43][44] Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein (S protein) and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection,[43] since the S protein triggers strong B-cell and T-cell immune responses.[45][46] However, other coronavirus proteins are also being investigated for vaccine development, like the nucleocapsid, because they also induce a robust T-cell response and their genes are more conserved and recombine less frequently.[46][47][48] Future generations of COVID‑19 vaccines targeting more conserved genomic regions could be used to treat future variations of SARS-CoV-2, or any similar coronavirus epidemic/pandemic.[49]

Platforms developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.[19][43][50][51]

Many vaccine technologies being developed for COVID‑19 use "next-generation" strategies for precise targeting of COVID‑19 infection mechanisms.[43][50][51] Several of the synthetic vaccines use a 2P mutation to lock the spike protein into its prefusion configuration, stimulating an adaptive immune response to the virus before it attaches to a human cell.[52] Vaccine platforms in development may improve flexibility for antigen manipulation and effectiveness for targeting mechanisms of COVID‑19 infection in susceptible population subgroups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.[43][50]
